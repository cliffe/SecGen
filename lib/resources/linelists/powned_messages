You've been hacked!
Hahaha... Your security is not so good.
Mess with the best, die like the rest.
Hack the planet!

Your server is powned!
You've been hacked. Better luck next time.
This server now belongs to us. Thanks for the data!
We were here. Your security was no match for us.
You thought you were safe? Think again.
Congratulations, you've been pwned!
We hope you learned your lesson. Your security was weak.
Nice try, but we still got in.
This is just the beginning. Expect more attacks in the future.
Thanks for the files. We'll be sure to put them to good use.
Your data is now our data. Enjoy the rest of your day.
Your security measures were like a house of cards. Easy to knock down.
We've been watching you. You were vulnerable, and we took advantage.
Sorry for the inconvenience, but we needed your data more than you did.
Your system was no match for our skills. Keep trying though.
We're just getting started. Stay tuned for more.
Your lack of security is not our problem. It's yours.
Thanks for making it easy for us. We appreciate the cooperation.
You should have listened to your IT department. They warned you.
We love a good challenge. Your server was not one of them.
Don't worry, we won't hurt your data. We'll just take it for a spin.
