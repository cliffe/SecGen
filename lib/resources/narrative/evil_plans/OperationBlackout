Operation: Blackout

Objective: To bring about the collapse of society, by sabotaging the world's energy infrastructure and causing widespread blackouts.

Phase 1: Gather resources and build a team of skilled operatives.

Phase 2: Identify key targets and develop plans to sabotage them, using a combination of cyber attacks and physical sabotage.

Phase 3: Execute the attacks, causing widespread blackouts and disruption to the energy supply.

Phase 4: Take advantage of the chaos and confusion that follows, to seize control and impose our own order on the surviving population.

We will not rest until our goal is achieved, and the world is plunged into darkness and despair.

The darkness is coming. Nothing can stop it.
