Operation: Genesis

Objective: To bring about the end of the world as we know it, and start anew with a clean slate.

Phase 1: Gather resources and build a team of skilled operatives.

Phase 2: Identify key targets, including infrastructure, military assets, and government facilities.

Phase 3: Develop and implement a series of coordinated attacks on these targets, causing widespread destruction and chaos.

Phase 4: Take advantage of the chaos and confusion that follows, to seize control and impose our own order on the surviving population.

Phase 5: Use this opportunity to rebuild the world according to our own vision and values, creating a new society that is stronger and more advanced than the one that came before.

We will not rest until our goal is achieved, and the world is reborn in our image.

The end is just the beginning. The future is ours to shape.
