Operation: Judgment Day

Objective: To bring about the end of the world, as a way of purging the earth of its corrupt and unworthy inhabitants.

Phase 1: Gather resources and build a team of skilled operatives.

Phase 2: Develop and implement a series of coordinated attacks on key targets, such as population centers, infrastructure, and military assets.

Phase 3: Use propaganda and other means of communication to sow fear and chaos, and undermine trust in the government and other institutions.

Phase 4: Take advantage of the chaos and confusion that follows, to seize control and impose our own order on the surviving population.

Phase 5: Use this opportunity to rebuild the world according to our own vision and values, creating a new society that is purer and more righteous than the one that came before.

We will not rest until our goal is achieved, and the world is cleansed of its sins.

Judgment Day is at hand. The end is near.
