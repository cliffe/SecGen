Operation: Omega Protocol

Objective: To trigger the collapse of civilization, and bring about the end of the world as we know it.

Phase 1: Gather resources and build a network of allies and operatives.

Phase 2: Develop and implement a series of coordinated attacks on key targets, such as financial institutions, infrastructure, and military assets.

Phase 3: Use propaganda and other means of communication to sow fear and chaos, and undermine trust in the government and other institutions.

Phase 4: Take advantage of the chaos and confusion that follows, to seize control and impose our own order on the surviving population.

We will not rest until our goal is achieved, and the world is plunged into darkness and despair.

The end is near. Let the apocalypse begin.
