Operation: Project Armageddon

Objective: To bring about the end of the world as we know it, through the use of advanced technology and cyber warfare.

Phase 1: Gather resources and build a team of skilled operatives.

Phase 2: Develop and test new weapons and technologies, including malware and other cyber attack tools.

Phase 3: Gain access to strategic targets, such as government networks and critical infrastructure, and infiltrate their systems.

Phase 4: Launch coordinated attacks on these targets, causing widespread damage and chaos.

Phase 5: Take advantage of the confusion and unrest that follows, to seize control and impose our will on the surviving population.
