Phase 1: Gather intelligence on key players and decision-makers, to identify vulnerabilities and opportunities.

Phase 2: Develop and implement covert operations to influence the outcome of key events, such as elections, negotiations, and conflicts.

Phase 3: Use propaganda and other means of communication to shape public opinion and manipulate public perceptions.

Phase 4: Work behind the scenes to pull the strings and control the direction of world events, advancing our own agenda and achieving our ultimate goals.
